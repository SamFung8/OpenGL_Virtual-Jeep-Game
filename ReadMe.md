# **1. Objectives** 
The objectives of this project are for students to have some hands-on experiences of graphics programming and to develop a graphics application. Students are given a Python/OpenGL program with a virtual jeep game and asked to extend this program to provide additional features.

# **2. Basic Requirements**
**1) Creating new objects (10 marks)**

Create or import at least one new object with color/material/texture properties and put it them at suitable locations.

**2) Menu and Lighting (10 marks)**

Add a pop-up menu to switch between different light properties (ambient, diffuse, specular and position, point lights, directional lights, spotlights).

**3) Manipulation (10 marks)**

Use keyboard/mouse to manipulate an object (size, position and angle) and the camera (position, angle and zoom-in/out).

**4) Adding autonomous objects (10 marks)**

Set an object to move around automatically and react to the environment (e.g. light).

**5) Window resolution (10 marks)**

Allow user to set/select the window resolution, enable/disable full screen mode before or during the application.

**6) Accelerating ribbon (10 marks)**

Set an accelerating ribbon on the road, and the jeep can be accelerated after passing the ribbon.

# **3. Advanced Requirements**
**1) Scouring and ranking system** 

When the game end, if the player can get the better result of the current top 10 ranking it will record and show the result.
