<h1> 1. Objectives </h1>
    The objectives of this project are for students to have some hands-on experiences of graphics
    programming and to develop a graphics application. Students are given a Python/OpenGL
    program with a virtual jeep game and asked to extend this program to provide additional features.

<h1> 2. Basic Requirements </h1>
    2.1. Creating new objects (10 marks)
            Create or import at least one new object with color,material,texture properties and put
            it them at suitable locations.

    2.2. Menu and Lighting (10 marks)
            Add a pop-up menu to switch between different light properties (ambient, diffuse, specular
            and position, point lights, directional lights, spotlights).

    <h2>2.3. Manipulation (10 marks)</h2>
    Use keyboard/mouse to manipulate an object (size, position and angle) and the camera
    (position, angle and zoom-in/out).

    <h2>2.4. Adding autonomous objects (10 marks)</h2>
    Set an object to move around automatically and react to the environment (e.g. light).

    <h2>2.5. Window resolution (10 marks)</h2>
    Allow user to set/select the window resolution, enable/disable full screen mode before or
    during the application.

    <h2>2.6. Accelerating ribbon (10 marks)</h2>
    Set an accelerating ribbon on the road, and the jeep can be accelerated after passing the
    ribbon.
