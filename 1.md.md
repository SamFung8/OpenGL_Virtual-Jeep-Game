# **1. Objectives** 
The objectives of this project are for students to have some hands-on experiences of graphics programming and to develop a graphics application. Students are given a Python/OpenGL program with a virtual jeep game and asked to extend this program to provide additional features.

# **2. Basic Requirements**
**1) Creating new objects (10 marks)**

Create or import at least one new object with color/material/texture properties and put it them at suitable locations.

**2) Menu and Lighting (10 marks)**

Add a pop-up menu to switch between different light properties (ambient, diffuse, specular and position, point lights, directional lights, spotlights).

**3) Manipulation (10 marks)**

Use keyboard/mouse to manipulate an object (size, position and angle) and the camera (position, angle and zoom-in/out).
